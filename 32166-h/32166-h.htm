<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Mr. Shan Bullock</span>, who needs no introduction
to those who read Irish books, has done
no better work than in this tribute to one
of the noblest Irishmen Ulster has produced in
modern times. I refer not only to the literary
merits of <i>Thomas Andrews, Shipbuilder</i>, which
speak for themselves, but rather to the true
insight with which he has fulfilled the precise
purpose held in view by those who asked him
to write this little memorial volume. What
that purpose was must be known in order that
the story itself, and the manner of the telling,
may be fully appreciated.</p>

<p>The book was written at the request of a few
Irishmen, myself among them, who work together
in a movement which seeks to develop
agriculture, and generally to improve the condition
of our rural communities. We are
deeply interested in the great achievements of
Ulster industry, because we hold strongly that
the prosperity of our country depends largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
upon the mutual understanding and the co-ordination
of effort between the two great
economic interests into which the Irish, in
common with most civilised peoples, are
divided. For this consummation Ireland
needs, in our opinion, industrial leaders with
a broader conception of the life of the country
as a whole. For such leaders we naturally
look, more especially those of us whose eyes
are turning towards the westering sun, to the
younger men. Among these none seemed to
us so ideally fitted to give practical expression
to our hopes as Thomas Andrews. Thus it
was the sense of the great loss the country had
sustained which set us thinking how the life
of the shipbuilder who had died so nobly could
be given its due place in the history of our
times—how the lesson of that life could be
handed down to the builders of ships and
of other things in the Ireland of our dreams.</p>

<p>The project having so originated, the proper
treatment of the subject had to be determined.
Unquestionably Thomas Andrews was a hero.
The wise Bishop Berkeley has said: “Every
man, by consulting his own heart, may easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
know whether he is or is not a patriot, but it
is not easy for the bystander.” A man cannot
thus know whether he is or is not a hero.
Both he and the bystander must wait for the
occasion to arise, and the opportunities for
exhibiting heroism are as rare and perilous as
those for exhibiting patriotism are common
and safe. To Thomas Andrews the supreme
test came—came in circumstances demanding
almost superhuman fortitude and self-control.
Here was not the wild excitement of battle
to sustain him; death had to be faced
calmly in order that others—to whom he must
not even bid farewell—might live. And so
in his last hour we see this brave, strong,
capable and lovable man displaying, not only
heroism, but every quality which had exalted
him in the regard of his fellows and endeared
him to all who had worked and lived with him.
This is the verdict of his countrymen now that
the facts of that terrible disaster are fully known.</p>

<p>Yet it was far from our purpose to have the
tragedy of the <i>Titanic</i> written with Thomas
Andrews as the hero. We deemed it better
to place the bare facts before some writer of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
repute, not one of his personal friends, and
ask him to tell in simple language the plain
tale of his life so far as it could be gleaned from
printed and written records, from his family,
friends, and employers; above all, from those
fellow-workers—his “pals” as he liked to call
them—to whom this book is most fittingly
dedicated. The story thus pieced together
would be chiefly concerned with his work, for
his work was his life.</p>

<p>To Thomas Andrews the hero, then, we did
not propose to raise a monument. To his
memory a fine memorial hall is to be built and
endowed in his native Comber by the inhabitants
of the town and district and his friends,
while he will be associated in memorials elsewhere
with those who died nobly in the wreck.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
These tributes will serve to remind us how he
died, but will not tell us how he lived. It is
the purpose of this short memoir to give a fairly
complete record of his life—his parentage, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>home, his education, his pleasures, his tastes
and his thoughts, so far as they are known,
upon things which count in the lives of peoples.
The family, and all from whom information
was sought, responded most cordially to
our wishes. There remained the difficulty
of finding a writer who could tell the story
of Thomas Andrews the man, as we wished it
to be told.</p>

<p>For such a task it was decided that, if he
could be induced to undertake it, the right
man was Shan Bullock. He is an Ulsterman,
a writer of tales of Ulster life, distinguished
among other Irish books by their sincerity and
unequalled understanding of the Ulster character.
While other Irish writers of imagination
and genius have used Irish life to express
their own temperament, Shan Bullock has
devoted his great literary ability almost entirely
to the patient, living and sincere study
of what Ulster really is in itself as a community
of men and women. It is true that his stories
are of rural and agricultural communities,
while the scene is now laid chiefly in a great
centre of manufacturing industry. But in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Mr. Bullock’s studies it is always the human
factor that predominates. One feels while
reading one of his tales that he loves to look
upon a man, especially an Ulster man. Here
was the ideal historian of the life of Thomas
Andrews.</p>

<p>It fell to me to approach Mr. Bullock. I
induced him to go and see the family, having
arranged with them to bring him into touch
with the authorities at the Island Works, who
were to show him round and introduce him
to many who knew our friend. He promised
me that he would look over all the material
out of which the story could be pieced together,
and that if he found that it “gripped”
him and became a labour of love he would
undertake it. The story did, as the reader
will see, grip him, and grip him hard, and
in telling it Mr. Bullock has rendered the
greatest of all his services to lovers of truth
told about Ireland by Irish writers.</p>

<p>It will now, I think, be clear why Thomas
Andrews has, notwithstanding his noble end,
been represented as the plain, hard-working
Ulster boy, growing into the exemplary and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
finally the heroic Ulster man that we knew.
We see him ever doing what his hand found
to do, and doing it with his might. Our author,
rightly as I think, makes no attempt to present
him as a public man; for this captain of industry
in the making was wholly absorbed in
his duties to the great Firm he served. None
the less I am convinced that the public side of
the man would not long have remained undeveloped—who
knows but that this very year
would have called him forth?—because he had
to my personal knowledge the right public
spirit. Concentration upon the work in hand
prevented his active participation in public
affairs, but his mastery over complicated
mechanical problems—his power to use materials—and
to organise bodies of men in their
use, would not, I believe, have failed him if
he had come to deal with the mechanics of the
nation.</p>

<p>These may be fruitless speculations now, and
Mr. Bullock wisely leaves us to draw our own
conclusions as to the eminence to which Thomas
Andrews might have attained had his life been
spared. Abundant proof of the immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
influence he might have exercised is furnished
in the eloquently sincere grief which pervades
the letters of condolence that poured into the
home of the parents at Comber when it was
known that they had lost their distinguished
son. They came—over seven hundred of
them—from all sorts and conditions of men,
ranging from a duke to a pauper in a workhouse.
In one of these letters, too intimate
to publish, a near relative pays to the dead
shipbuilder a pathetically simple tribute with
which I may well leave to the reader Mr
Bullock’s tale of a noble life and heroic death.
“There is not,” ran this fine epitaph, “a
better boy in heaven.”</p>

<h2>THOMAS  ANDREWS<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
SHIPBUILDER</h2>



<h2>I.</h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">For</span> six generations the Andrews family has
been prominent in the life of Comber: that
historic and prospering village, near Strangford
Lough, on the road from Belfast to Downpatrick:
and in almost every generation some
one or other of the family has attained distinction.
During the eventful times of 1779-82,
John Andrews raised and commanded a company
of Volunteers, in which his youngest son,
James, served as Lieutenant. Later, another
John Andrews was High Sheriff of Down in
1857; and he also it was who founded the firm
of John Andrews &amp; Co., which to-day gives
employment to some six hundred of the
villagers. The present head of the family,
William Drennan Andrews, LL.D., was a Judge
of the High Court, Ireland, from 1882, and
has been a Privy Councillor since 1897. His
brother, Thomas Andrews, is a man whose outstanding
merits and sterling character have won<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
him an honoured place among Ulstermen. One
of the famous Recess Committee of 1895, he is
President of the Ulster Liberal Unionist Association,
Chairman of the Belfast and County Down
Railway Company, a Privy Councillor, a Deputy
Lieutenant of Down, High Sheriff of the same
county, and Chairman of its County Council.
Two more brothers, James and John, were
Justices of the Peace. In 1870 Thomas
Andrews married Eliza Pirrie, a descendant of
the Scotch Hamiltons, Lord Pirrie’s sister, and
herself a woman of the noblest type.</p>

<p>To these, and of such excellent stock, was
born, on February 7th, 1873, a son, named after
his father, and described in the family record as
Thomas Andrews of Dunallan. His eldest
brother, John Miller, born in 1871, and his
youngest brother, William, born in 1886, are
now Managing Directors of John Andrews &amp;
Co., Ltd., under the Chairmanship of their
father. A third brother, James, born in 1877,
adopted the profession of his distinguished
uncle, and is now a barrister-at-law. His only
sister, Eliza Montgomery, married in 1906,
Lawrence Arthur, the third son of Jesse Hind,
Esq., J.P., of Edwalton, Notts, and a solicitor
of the Supreme Court.</p>

alt="Ardara, Comber" title="Ardara, Comber" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">ARDARA, COMBER</p>

<p>Tom was, we are told, “a healthy, energetic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
bonny child, and grew into a handsome, plucky
and lovable boy.” His home training was of
the wisest, and of a kind, one thinks, not commonly
given to Ulster boys in those more
austere times of his youth. “No one,” writes
his brother John, “knew better than Tom how
much he owed to that healthy home life in
which we were brought up. We were never
otherwise treated than with more than kindness
and devotion, and we learned the difference
between right and wrong rather by example
than by precept.” To Tom, his father, then
and always, was as an elder brother, full of
understanding and sympathy; nor did his
mother, even to the end, seem to him other
than a sister whose life was as his own. He and
his elder brother, John, were inseparable
comrades, there among the fields of Comber
and in their beautiful home, with its old lawn
and gardens, its avenue winding past banks of
rhododendrons, the farm behind, outside the
great mill humming busily, and in front the
gleam of Strangford Lough. Both father and
mother being advocates of temperance, encouraged
their lads to abstain from tobacco
and strong drink; and to this end their good
mother offered to give a tempting prize to such
of her sons as could on their twenty-first birthday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
say they had so abstained. Tom, and
each of his brothers, not only claimed his
prize but continued throughout life to act
upon the principles it signalised. Doubtless at
times, being human boys, they fell into mischief:
but only once, their father states, was
bodily punishment given to either, and then,
as fate willed it, he boxed the ear of the wrong
boy!</p>

<p>Quite early, young Tom, like many another
lad, developed a fondness for boats, and because
of his manifest skill in the making of these he
gained among his friends the nickname of
“Admiral.” In other respects also the man
who was to be showed himself in the boy. He
had a beautiful way with children. He loved
animals of every kind and had over them such
influence that they would follow him and come
to his call. Still at Ardara, in shelter of the
hedge, you may see his nine hives of bees,
among which he used to spend many happy
hours, and to which in later times he devoted
much of his hard-won leisure: once, his mother
will tell you, spending a whole winter’s day—and
a hunting day too!—carrying his half-famished
workers to and fro between hive and
kitchen in his cap. For horses he had a passion,
and particularly for the Shetland pony given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to him one birthday. The fiercest brute
yielded to his quiet mastery; he never used
whip or spur; and in time he was known as one
of the straightest and most fearless riders to
hounds in County Down.</p>

<p>Until the age of eleven he was educated
privately by a tutor, but in September, 1884,
he became a student at the Royal Academical
Institution, Belfast—the same institution
through which, some years previously, his
father and his uncle, then Mr. Pirrie, had
passed. There he showed no special aptitudes,
being fonder apparently of games than
of study, and not yet having developed those
powers of industry for which, soon, he became
notable. In the Institution, however,
was no more popular boy, both with masters
and schoolfellows. He excelled at cricket,
one is glad to know, and at all manly sports.
Even then, we are told, generosity and a fine
sympathy were prominent traits in his character.
“He was always happy,” writes a playmate,
“even-tempered, and showed a developing
power of impressing everyone with his honesty
and simplicity of purpose.” Wherever he
went Tom carried his own sunshine. All
were fond of him. One can see him returning
with his brother from school, big, strong, well-favored,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and perhaps with some premonition
of what the future had in store, lingering
sometimes near the station doorway to watch
the great ships rising above the Island Yard
close by and to listen for a minute to the hammers
beating some great vessel into shape:
and whilst he stands there, grave and thoughtful
for a minute, one may write here the judgment
of his parents upon him, “He never
caused us a moment’s anxiety in his life.”</p>



<h2>II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">When</span> he was sixteen, on the 1st May, 1889,
Tom left school, and as a premium apprentice
entered the shipyard of Messrs. Harland &amp;
Wolff. In one important respect the date of
his entry may be accounted fortunate, for about
that time, chiefly through the enterprise of the
White Star Company in the matter of constructing
a fleet of giant ships for the Atlantic
service, great developments were imminent, if
not already begun, in the shipping world. To
a boy of sixteen, however, the change from the
comforts of home and the comparative freedom
of school-life to the stern discipline of the yards
must have been exacting. It was work now,
and plenty of it, summer and winter, day in
day out, the hardest he could do at the hardest
could be given him. He was to be tested to the
full. With characteristic wisdom, Mr. Pirrie
had decided that no favour whatever was to be
shown the boy on the score of relationship.
By his own efforts and abilities he must make
his way, profiting by no more than the inspiration
of his uncle’s example: and if he failed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
well, that too was a way many another had
gone before him.</p>

<p>But Tom was not of the breed that fails.
He took to his work instantly and with enthusiasm.
Distance from home necessitated his
living through the workaday week in Belfast.
Every morning he rose at ten minutes to five
and was at work in the Yard punctually by six
o’clock. His first three months were spent in
the Joiner’s shop, the next month with the
Cabinet makers, the two following months working
in ships. There followed two months in the
Main store; then five with the Shipwrights, two
in the Moulding loft, two with the Painters,
eight with the iron Shipwrights, six with the
Fitters, three with the Pattern-makers, eight
with the Smiths. A long spell of eighteen
months in the Drawing office completed his
term of five years as an apprentice.</p>

alt="Harland and Wolff’s turbine erecting shop" title="Harland and Wolff’s turbine erecting shop" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">HARLAND AND WOLFF’S TURBINE ERECTING SHOP</p>

<p>Throughout that long ordeal Tom inspired
everyone who saw him, workmen, foremen,
managers, and those in higher authority, as
much by the force of his personal character as
by his qualities of industry. Without doubt
here was one destined to success. He was
thorough to the smallest detail. He mastered
everything with the ease of one in love with his
task. We have a picture of him drawn by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
comrade, in his moleskin trousers and linen
jacket, and instinctively regarded by his fellow-apprentices
as their leader, friend and adviser in
all matters of shipyard lore and tradition.
“He was some steps ahead of me in his progress
through the Yard,” the account goes on, “so
I saw him only at the breakfast and luncheon
hours, but I can remember how encouraging
his cheery optimism and unfailing friendship
were to one who found the path at
times far from easy and the demands on
one’s patience almost more than could be
endured.” Many a workman, too, with whom
he wrought at that time will tell you to-day,
and with a regret at his untimely loss as pathetic
as it is sincere, how faithful he was, how upstanding,
generous. He would work at full
pressure in order to gain time to assist an old
workman “in pulling up his job.” He would
share his lunch with a mate, toil half the night
in relief of a fellow-apprentice who had been
overcome by sickness, or would plunge gallantly
into a flooded hold to stop a leakage. “It
seemed his delight,” writes a foreman, “to
make those around him happy. His was ever
the friendly greeting and the warm handshake
and kind disposition.” Such testimony is
worth pages of outside eulogy, and testimony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of its kind, from all sorts and conditions, exists
in abundance.</p>

<p>The long day’s work over at the Island, many
a young man would have preferred, and
naturally perhaps, to spend his evenings
pleasurably: not so Tom Andrews. Knowing
the necessity, if real success were to
be attained, of perfecting himself on the
technical as much as on the practical side of
his profession, and perhaps having a desire also
to make good what he considered wasted
opportunities at school, he pursued, during the
five years of his apprenticeship, and afterwards
too, a rigid course of night studies: in this way
gaining an excellent knowledge of Machine and
Freehand drawing, of Applied mechanics, and
the theory of Naval architecture. So assiduously
did he study that seldom was he in bed
before eleven o’clock; he read no novels, wasted
no time over newspapers; and hardly could be
persuaded by his friends to give them his
company for an occasional evening. His weekly
game of cricket or hockey, with a day’s hunting
now and then or an afternoon’s yachting on the
Lough, gave him all the relaxation he could
permit himself; and by 1894, when his term of
apprenticeship ended, the thrill of hitting a
ball over the boundary (and Tom was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mighty hitter who felt the thrill often) was
experienced with less and still less frequency,
whilst sometimes now, and more frequently as
time went on, the joy of spending Sunday with
his dear folk at Comber had to be foregone.
Even when the Presidency of the Northern
Cricket Union was pressed upon him, such were
the stern claims of duty that the pleasure of
accepting it had ruthlessly to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>What grit, what zest and sense of duty, the
boy—for he was no more—must have had, so
to labour and yet to thrive gloriously! Perfect
health, his sound physique, his sunny nature, and
strict adherence to the principles of temperance
encouraged by his mother, helped him to
attain fine manhood. During the period of his
apprenticeship he was up to time on every
morning of the five years except one—and of
his doings on that fateful morning a story is told
which, better perhaps than any other, throws
light upon his character.</p>

<p>It was a good custom of the firm to award a
gold watch to every pupil who ended his term
without being late once. That morning Tom’s
clock had failed to ring its alarm at the usual
time, so despite every endeavour the boy could
not reach the gates before ten minutes past six.
He might, by losing the whole day and making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
some excuse, have escaped penalty: instead, he
waited outside the gates until eight o’clock and
went in to work at the breakfast hour.</p>

<p>One other story relating to this period is told
by his mother. It too reveals distinctive points
of character.</p>

<p>On an occasion Tom, with several fellow-pupils,
went on a walking tour during the
Easter holidays over the Ards peninsula.
Crossing Strangford Lough at Portaferry, they
visited St. John’s Point, the most easterly part
of Ireland; then, finding the tide favourable,
crossed the sands from Ballykinler to Dundrum—Tom
carrying the youngest of the party on his
back through a deep intervening stretch of
water—and thence, by way of Newcastle,
proceeded across the mountains to Rostrevor.</p>

<p>In their hotel at Rostrevor the boys, during
an excess of high spirits, broke the rail of a
bedstead; whereupon Tom, assuming responsibility,
told the landlady that he would bear the
expense of repairing the break. She answered
that in her hotel they did not keep patched
beds, consequently would be troubling him for
the cost of a new one.</p>

<p>“If so, the old one belongs to me,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Provided you’ll be taking it away,”
countered the dame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy argued no further, but finding
presently, through a friendly chambermaid, an
old charwoman who said her sick husband
would rejoice in the luxury of the bedstead, he
offered to mend it and give it to her.</p>

<p>“Ah, but wouldn’t it be more than my place
is worth, child dear,” she answered, “for the
like of me to be taking it from the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Tom. “Give me
your address, borrow a screw driver, and I’ll
see to it.”</p>

<p>So he and his companions, having roughly
repaired the rail, took the bedstead to pieces,
and, applauded by the visitors, carried it to the
street. A good-natured tram conductor
allowed them to load their burden on an end of
his car. Soon they reached the woman’s home,
bore in the bedstead, set it up in the humble
room, raised the old man and his straw mattress
upon it from the floor, made him comfortable,
and dowered with all the blessings the old couple
could invoke upon them, went away happy.</p>



<h2>III.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">So</span> much impressed was the firm with Tom’s
industry and capacity that, soon after the time
of his entering the Drawing Office in November,
1892, he was entrusted with the discharge of
responsible duties. It is on record that in
February, 1893, he was given the supervision of
construction work on the <i>Mystic</i>; that in
November of the same year he represented the
firm, to its entire satisfaction and his own credit,
on the trials of the White Star Liner <i>Gothic</i>;
whilst, immediately following the end of his
apprenticeship in May, 1894, he helped the
Shipyard Manager to examine the <i>Coptic</i>, went
to Liverpool and reported on the damage done
to the <i>Lycia</i>, and in November discussed with
the General Manager and Shipyard Manager
the Notes in connection with the renovation of
the <i>Germanic</i>—that famous Liner, still capable
after twenty-five years on the Atlantic Service
of making record passages, but now crippled
through being overladen with ice at New York.</p>

<p>In 1894 he was twenty-one years old: a man
and well launched on his great career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary, and scarcely possible, to
follow Andrews with any closeness as rapidly,
step by step, he climbed the ladder already
scaled, with such amazing success, by Mr.
Pirrie. The record of his career is written in
the wonderful story of the Queen’s Island Yard
through all its developments onward from 1894,
and in the story of the many famous ships
repaired and built during the period.</p>

<p>The remarkable engineering feat of lengthening
the <i>Scot</i> and the <i>Augusta Victoria</i>, by
dividing the vessels and inserting a section
amidships; the reconstruction of the <i>China</i>
after its disaster at Perim and of the <i>Paris</i>
following its wreck on the Manacles: in these
operations, covering roughly the years 1896-1900,
Andrews, first as an outside Manager and
subsequently as Head of the Repair department,
took a distinguished part. He was growing,
widening knowledge, maturing capacity,
and both by the Staff, and by those in touch
with the Yard, he became recognised as what
the watching crowd terms, not unhappily, a
coming man.</p>

<p>Having made his mark in the Repair Department,
Andrews was next to prove himself on
construction work. Prior to the launch of the
<i>Oceanic</i> in 1899, and whilst engaged in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
reconstruction operations already mentioned,
he had also rendered good service at the building
of ships for many of the great steamship lines;
but it was perhaps with the building of the
<i>Celtic</i> (1899-1901), when he became Manager
of Construction Work, that the path of his
career took him swiftly up into prominence.
The duty of supervising all the structural
details of the vessel brought him into close
practical touch with the Drawing office, the
Moulding loft, the Platers’ shops, and all the
other Departments through which he had
passed as an apprentice; imposed upon his
young shoulders great responsibilities; tested
his capacity for handling men; put him in
constant and intimate view of his employers;
widened his relations with owners, contractors,
directors, managers; opened to him not only
the life of the Yard, but the vast outer life of
the Shipping and Commercial world, and in a
hundred other respects helped towards his
development as a shipbuilder and a man. Now
he had opportunity to apply his knowledge and
experience, to express in tangible form his
genius. The great ship rising there below the
gantries to the accompaniment of such clang
and turmoil—she was his, part of him. To the
task, one of the noblest surely done by men, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
gave himself unsparingly, every bit of him,
might and main: and his success, great as it
was, had the greater acclaim because in achieving
it he worked not for personal success but for
success in his work. That was the man’s way.
His job, first and last and always.</p>

<p>The names alone of all the ships in whose
building Andrews had a hand, more or less, as
Designer, Constructor, Supervisor and Adviser,
would fill this page. The <i>Cedric</i>, the <i>Baltic</i>,
the <i>Adriatic</i>, the <i>Oceanic</i>, the <i>Amerika</i>, the
<i>President Lincoln</i> and <i>President Grant</i>, the
<i>Nieuw Amsterdam</i>, the <i>Rotterdam</i>, the <i>Lapland</i>
(of which recently we have heard so much):
those are a few of them. The <i>Olympic</i> and the
<i>Titanic</i>: those are two more. Their names
are as familiar to us as those of our friends.
We have, some of us, seen the great ships on
whose bows they are inscribed, perhaps sailed in
them, or watched anxiously for their arrival at
some port of the world; well, wherever they sail
now, or lie, they have upon them the impress of
Tom Andrews’ hand and brain, and with one
of them, the last and finest of all, he himself
gloriously perished.</p>

<p>There are many others, less known perhaps,
but carrying the flag no less proudly upon the
Seven seas, for whose design and construction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Andrews was in some measure, often in great
measure responsible: the <i>Aragon</i>, the <i>Amazon</i>,
the <i>Avon</i>, the <i>Asturias</i>, the <i>Arlanza</i>, the
<i>Herefordshire</i>, the <i>Leicestershire</i>, the <i>Gloucestershire</i>,
the <i>Oxfordshire</i>, the <i>Pericles</i>, the <i>Themistocles</i>,
the <i>Demosthenes</i>, the <i>Laurentic</i>, the
<i>Megantic</i>, and the rest. It is a splendid record.
Lord Pirrie may well be proud of it, and Ulster
too: both we know are proud of the man who
so devotedly helped to make it.</p>

<p>The work of building all those ships, and so
many more, from the <i>Celtic</i> to the <i>Titanic</i>,
covered a period of some thirteen years, 1899-1912,
and in that period Andrews gained
such advancement as his services to the Firm
deserved. In 1904 he became Assistant Chief
Designer, and in the year following was promoted
to be Head of the Designing department
under Lord Pirrie. His age then was
thirty-two, an age at which most men are
beginning their career; but he already had
behind him what may seem the work and
experience of a strenuous lifetime.</p>

<p>“When first I knew Mr. Andrews,” writes
one who knew him intimately, and later was
closely associated with him in his work, “he
was a young man, but young as he was to him
were entrusted the most important and responsible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
duties—the direct supervision of constructing
the largest ships built in the Yard
from the laying of their keels until their sailing
from Belfast. Such a training eminently fitted
him for the important position to which he
succeeded in 1905, that of Chief of the Designing
department. For one so young the position
involved duties that taxed him to the full.
To superintend the construction of ships like
the <i>Baltic</i> and <i>Oceanic</i> was a great achievement,
but at the age of thirty-two to be Chief of a
department designing leviathans like the
<i>Olympic</i> was a greater one still. How well he
rose to the call everyone knows. No task
was too heavy, and none too light, for him to
grapple with successfully. He seemed endowed
with boundless energy, and his interest in his
work was unceasing.”</p>

<p>Others who knew him well during this
important period of his career testify in the like
manner.</p>

<p>“Diligent to the point of strenuousness,”
wrote one of them, “thinking whilst others
slept, reading while others played, through
sheer toil and ability he made for himself a
position that few of his years attain”; and then
the writer, whose ideal of life is character, notes
approvingly and justly that Andrews worked not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as a hireling, but in the spirit of an artist whose
work must satisfy his own exacting conscience.</p>

<p>Those boundless energies soon were given
wider scope. Early in 1907 the <i>Adriatic</i> was
finished, and in March of that same year he was
made a Managing Director of the Firm, the
Right Hon. A.&nbsp;M. Carlisle being at this time
Chairman of the Board. Everyone knows,
or can judge for himself, what were the duties
of this new position—this additional position,
rather, for he still remained Chief of the
Designing department—and what, in such
a huge and complicated concern as the Island
works, the duties involved. Briefly we may
summarise them.</p>

<p>A knowledge of its fifty-three branches
equal to that of any of the fifty-three men
in charge of them; the supervising these,
combining and managing them so that all
might, smoothly and efficiently, work to the
one great end assigned, the keeping abreast
with the latest devices in labour-saving
appliances, with the newest means of securing
economical fitness, with the most modern
discoveries in electrical, mechanical and
marine engineering—in short, everything relative
to the construction and equipment of
modern steamships; and in addition all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
numerous and delicate duties devolving upon
him as Lord Pirrie’s Assistant. Furthermore,
the many voyages of discovery, so to
speak, which he made as representative of the
Firm, thereby, we are told by one with whom
he sailed often, “gaining a knowledge of sea
life and the art of working a ship unequalled
in my experience by anyone not by profession a
seafarer”; and, lastly, his many inspections of,
and elaborate reports upon, ships and business
works, together with his survey, at Lord Pirrie’s
instance, of the Harbours of Ireland, Canada,
Germany, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It seems a giant’s task. Even to us poor humdrum
mortals, toiling meanly on office stools
at our twopenny enterprises, it seems more than
a giant’s task. Yet Andrews shouldered it,
unweariedly, cheerily, joyfully, for pure love
of the task.</p>

<p>One sees him, big and strong, a paint-smeared
bowler hat on his crown, grease on his
boots and the pockets of his blue jacket stuffed
with plans, making his daily round of the Yards,
now consulting his Chief, now conferring with
a foreman, now interviewing an owner, now
poring over intricate calculations in the Drawing
office, now in company with his warm friend,
old schoolfellow, and co-director, Mr. George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Cumming of the Engineering department,
superintending the hoisting of a boiler by the
two hundred ton crane into some newly
launched ship by a wharf. Or he runs amok
through a gang—to their admiration, be it
said—found heating their tea-cans before horn-blow;
or comes unawares upon a party enjoying
a stolen smoke below a tunnel-shaft,
and, having spoken his mind forcibly, accepts
with a smile the dismayed sentinel’s excuse that
“’twasn’t fair to catch him by coming like that
into the tunnel instead of by the way he was
expected.” Or he kicks a red hot rivet, which
has fallen fifty feet from an upper deck, missing
his head by inches, and strides on laughing at
his escape. Or he calls some laggard to stern
account, promising him the gate double quick
without any talk next time. Or he lends a
ready hand to one in difficulties; or just in time
saves another from falling down a hold; or
saying that married men’s lives are precious,
orders back a third from some dangerous place
and himself takes the risk. Or he runs into
the Drawing office with a hospital note and a
gift of flowers and fruit for the sick wife of a
draughtsman. Or at horn-blow he stands by
a ship’s gangway, down which four thousand
hungry men, with a ninety feet drop below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
them, are rushing for home and supper, and
with voice and eye controls them ... a
guard rope breaks ... another instant and
there may be grim panic on the gangway ...
but his great voice rings out, “Stand back,
men,” and he holds them as in a leash until
the rope is made good again.</p>

<p>All in the day’s work, those and a thousand
other incidents which men treasure to-day in
the Island, and, if you are tactful, will reveal to
you in their slow laconic Northern way. He
has been in the Yard perhaps since four or five
o’clock—since six for a certainty. At seven or
so he will trudge home, or ride in a tramcar
with the other workers, to sit over his plans or
his books well into the night.</p>

<p>One recalls a day, not long ago, spent most of
it in tramping over the Island Works, guided by
two men who had worked for many years with
Andrews and who, like others we saw and
thousands we did not see, held his memory
almost in reverence. In and out, up and down
we went, through heat and rain, over cobble
stones and tram lines; now stepping on planks
right down the double bottom, three hundred
yards long, from which was soon to rise the
<i>Titanic’s</i> successor; now crouching amongst the
shores sustaining the huge bulk of another half-plated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
giant; now passing in silent wonder
along the huge cradles and ways above which
another monster stood ready for launching.
Then into shop after shop in endless succession,
each needing a day’s journey to traverse, each
wonderfully clean and ordered, and all full of
wonders. Boilers as tall as houses, shafts a
boy’s height in diameter, enormous propellers
hanging like some monstrous sea animal in
chains, turbine motors on which workmen
clambered as upon a cliff, huge lathes, pneumatic
hammers, and quiet slow-moving machines
that dealt with cold steel, shearing it, punching
it, planing it, as if it had been so much dinner
cheese. Then up into the Moulding Loft,
large enough for a football ground, and its floor
a beautiful maze of frame lines; on through the
Joiners’ shops, with their tools that can do everything
but speak; through the Smiths’ shops,
with their long rows of helmet-capped hearths,
and on into the great airy building, so full of
interest that one could linger in it for a week,
where an army of Cabinetmakers are fashioning
all kinds of ship’s furniture. Then across into
the Central power station, daily generating
enough electricity to light Belfast. On through
the fine arched Drawing hall, where the spirit
of Tom Andrews seemed still to linger, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
into his office where often he sat drafting those
reports, so exhaustively minute, so methodical
and neatly penned, which now have such
pathetic and revealing interest. Lastly, after
such long journeying, out to a wharf and over
a great ship, full of stir and clamour, and as
thronged with workmen as soon it would be
with passengers.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="turning" id="turning"></a><a href="images/illo047.jpg"><img src="images/illo047_th.jpg"
alt="The turning shop" title="The turning shop" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">THE TURNING SHOP</p>

<p>And often, as one went, hour after hour, one
kept asking, “Had Mr. Andrews knowledge of
this, and this, and that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of everything—he knew everything,”
would be the patient answer.</p>

<p>“And could he do this, and this, and this?”
one kept on.</p>

<p>“He could do anything,” would be the
answer.</p>

<p>“Even how to drive an engine?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“And how to rivet a plate?”</p>

<p>“He could have built a ship himself, and
fitted her—yes, and sailed her too”—was the
answer we got; and then as one dragged
wearily towards the gateway (outside which,
you will remember, young Tom waited one
bitter morning, disappointed but staunch) the
guide, noting one’s plight, said, “You will
sleep well to-night?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>”</p>

<p>Why, yes, one felt like sleeping for a week!</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” was the quiet comment, “Mr.
Andrews would do all that and more three
times maybe every day.”</p>

<p>All in the day’s work, you see. And when
it was done, then home in a tramcar, to have
his dinner, a talk with his mother over the
telephone, and so to work again until eleven.</p>

<p>In 1901 Andrews became a Member of the
Institution of Naval Architects, and in the
year following a Member of the Institution
of Mechanical Engineers. He was also a
Member of the Society of Naval Architects
and Marine Engineers (New York), and an
Honorary Member of the Belfast Association
of Engineers.</p>

<p>In 1908 he made a home for himself at
Dunallan, Windsor Avenue, Belfast, marrying,
on June 24th, Helen Reilly, younger daughter
of the late John Doherty Barbour, of Conway,
Dunmurry, County Antrim, D.L.—worthiest
and most loyal of helpmates.</p>

<p>Concerning his married life, so woefully
restricted in point of years as it was rich in
bounty of happiness, it is perhaps sufficient to
say here that, just before he sailed from
Southampton, in April last, on that final tragic
voyage, he made occasion, one evening whilst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
talking with a friend, to contrast his own lot
with the lot of some husbands he knew; saying,
amongst other things, that in the whole time
since his marriage, no matter how often he had
been away or how late he had stayed at the
Yard, never had Mrs. Andrews made a complaint.</p>

<p>She would not. With Jane Eyre she could
say, “I am my husband’s life as fully as he is
mine.”</p>

<p>In 1910 a child was born to them and named
Elizabeth Law Barbour.</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">All</span> this is important, vital a great deal of it;
but after all what concerns us chiefly, in this
brief record, is the kind of man Thomas
Andrews was—that and the fine end he made.
Everything, one supposes, in this workaday
world, must eventually be expressed in terms
of character. Though a man build the Atlantic
fleet, himself with superhuman vigour of hand
and brain, and have not character, what
profiteth it him, and how much the less
profiteth it the fleets maybe, at last?</p>

<p>Perhaps of all the manual professions that of
shipbuilding is the one demanding from those
engaged in it, masters and men, the sternest
rectitude. Good enough in the shipyard is
never enough. Think what scamped work, a
flawed shaft, a badly laid plate, an error in
calculation, may mean some wild night out in
the Atlantic; and when next you are in Belfast
go to Queen’s Island and see there, in the shops,
on the slips, how everyone is striving, or being
made to strive, on your behalf and that of all
who voyage, for the absolute best—everything
to a hair’s breadth, all as strong and sound as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hands can achieve, each rivet of all the millions
in a liner (perhaps the most impressive thing
one saw) tested separately and certified with its
own chalk mark.</p>

<p>Well, Andrews, to the extent of his powers
and position, was responsible for that absolute
best, and the fact that he was proves his
character—but does not of itself establish his
claim to a place high and apart. Many others
assuredly have succeeded as speedily and notably
as he, taking success at its material valuation,
and their names are written, or one day
will be written in the sand; but irrespective
of the great work he did and the great success
he achieved, Andrews was a man, in the opinion
of all who knew him, whose name deserves to
be graven in enduring characters: and why
that is so has yet, to some extent at least, to
be shown.</p>

<p>In appearance he made a fine figure, standing
nearly six feet high, weighing some two hundred
pounds, well-built, straight, with broad
shoulders and great physical development.
He had dark brown hair, sharp clean-shaven
features; you would call him handsome; his
brown eyes met yours with a look of the
frankest kindliness, and when he gripped your
hand he took you, as it were, to himself. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as you see him in a portrait you feel constrained
to exclaim, as many did at first sight of him,
“Well, <i>that’s</i> a man!” He had a wonderful
ringing laugh, an easy way with him, an Irishman’s
appreciation of humour. He was sunny,
big-hearted, full of gaiety. He loved to hear
a good story, and could tell you one as well
as another. He had the luck to be simple in
his habits and pleasures, his food, his dress, his
tastes. Give him health, plenty of friends,
plenty of work, and occasionally some spare
hours in which to enjoy a good book (Maeterlinck’s
<i>Life of the Bee</i> for preference) and some
good music, to go yachting on Strangford
Lough, or picnicking at the family bungalow
on Braddock Island, or for a long jolly ride with
Mrs. Andrews in their little Renault round the
Ards Peninsula, and he was thoroughly content.
When of a Saturday evening he opened the
door, so the servants at Ardara used to say,
they like all the rest waiting expectantly for his
coming, it was as though a wind from the sea
swept into the house. All was astir. His
presence filled the place. Soon you would hear
his father’s greeting, “Well, my big son, how
are you?” and thereafter, for one more
week’s end, it was in Ardara as though the
schoolboy was home for a holiday. You would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hear Tom’s voice and laugh through the house
and his step on the stairs; you would see him,
gloved and veiled, out working among his bees,
scampering on the lawn with the children, or
playing with the dog, or telling many a good
story to the family circle. Everyone loved
him—everyone.</p>

<p>A distinguished writer, Mr. Erskine Childers,
in an estimate of Andrews, judges that the
charm of the man lay in a combination of power
and simplicity. Others tell how unassertive he
was, and modest in the finest sense; “one of
nature’s gentlemen,” says a foreman who owed
him much, no pride at all, ready always to take
a suggestion from anyone, always expressing his
views quietly and considerately; “having of
himself,” writes Mrs. Andrews, “the humblest
opinion of anyone I ever knew.” And then
she quotes some lines he liked and wrote in her
album:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Do what you can, being what you are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine like a glow-worm, if you cannot as a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work like a pulley, if you cannot as a crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be a wheel-greaser, if you cannot drive a train”;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="ni">and goes on to say how much Judge Payne’s
familiar lines express the spirit and motive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of his actions throughout life, and how always
he had such a love for humanity that everyone
with whom he came in contact felt the
tremendous influence of his unselfish nature.
He was never so happy as when giving and
helping. Many a faltering youth on the
threshold of the world he took by the arm
and led forward. A shipwright testifies
“to his frequent acknowledgment of what
others, not so high as himself, tried to do.”
Another calls him “a kind and considerate
chief and a good friend always.” A third, in a
letter full of heartbreak at his loss, pays him
fine tribute: “In the twenty years I have
known him I never saw in him a single crooked
turn. He was always the same, one of the most
even-tempered men I ever worked with.”</p>

<p>Such spontaneous testimony to character is
perhaps sufficient; but one may crown it by
repeating a story told, with full appreciation
of its value, by his mother. When King
Edward and Queen Alexandra made their
memorable visit to Belfast in July, 1903, the
line of route passed through the street in
which Andrews lived; and to witness the
procession he invited to his rooms, all decorated
for the occasion and plentifully supplied with
dainties, a large party of children. “Well, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
dear,” one was asked afterwards, “and what
did you think of the King?” “The King,”
answered the child—“oh, cousin Tommy was
<i>our</i> King.”</p>

<p>Regarding his remarkable powers of application
and industry, enough too has perhaps
already been written; but what must be made
clear, even at the cost of repetition, for therein
lay the man’s strength, was the spirit in which
he approached the great business of work.</p>

<p>It has been said, and doubtless will be said
again, that for one to labour as Andrews did,
whatever the incentive or object, is an inhuman
process making for narrowness of manhood and
a condition of drudgery. Perhaps so. Herbert
Spencer once expressed some such opinion. It
is largely a question of one’s point of view, to a
lesser extent perhaps a matter of aptitude or
circumstance. At all events, in this respect,
it seems wise to distinguish as between man and
man, and work and work; for with the example
of Andrews before them even cavillers must
admit that what they call drudgery can be well
justified.</p>

<p>How he would have laughed had someone,
even a Herbert Spencer, called him a drudge!
Anyone less the creature, however you regarded
him, you could not easily find. Work was his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
nature, his life; he throve upon it, lived for it,
loved it. And think what a work it was! The
noblest, one repeats, done by men.</p>

<p>In his dressingroom was hung a framed copy
of Henry Van Dyke’s well-known sonnet. It
is worth quoting:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Let me but do my work from day to day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In field or forest, at the desk or loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In roaring market-place, or tranquil room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me but find it in my heart to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When vagrant wishes beckon me astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is my work, my blessing, not my doom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all who live, I am the one by whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This work can best be done in my own way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall I see it not too great nor small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To suit my spirit and to prove my powers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall I cheerfully greet the labouring hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheerful turn, when the long shadows fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At eventide, to play, and love, and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I know for me my work is best.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“This is my work, my blessing, not my doom
... because I know for me my work is best”:
can it be said that the man who worked in the
spirit of those words, having them before him
like a prayer each morning and each night, was
not fulfilling destiny in a noble way? No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mean thought of self, no small striving after
worldly success, but always the endeavour to
work in his own way to suit his spirit and to
prove his powers. If that way be narrow—well,
so is the way narrow that leads to eternal
life.</p>

<p>But, it might be said, Andrews had such
opportunity and the rare good fortune also to
have his spirit suited with work that proved
his powers. It was so. Yet one knows certainly
that had his opportunity been different
he would still have seized it; have been the
best engine driver in Ulster or have greased
wheels contentedly and with all diligence.
One remembers the sentence from Ruskin which
he had printed on his Christmas card for 1910:
“What we think, or what we know, or what we
believe, is in the end of little consequence.
The only thing of consequence is what we do.”</p>

<p>The best doing, always and every way, one
knows how that aspiration would appeal to
Andrews, good Unitarian that he was; just as
one knows how Ruskin, he who made roads and
had such burning sympathy always with honest
workers, would have appreciated Andrews and
agreed that the name of such a man should not
perish as have the names of most other of the
world’s great Architects and Builders. “To-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I commence my twenty-first year at the
works, all interesting and happy days. I would
go right back over them again if I could”:
one feels that the spirit of those words, written
by Andrews to his wife on May 1st, 1909,
would have appealed to Ruskin; and had he
known the man would he not have noted, as
did another observer—Professor W.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.
Adams,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Oxford—“how it was to the human
question the man’s mind always turned,” and
been eager to judge, “that here was one who
had in him the true stuff of the best kind of
captain of industry”?</p>

<p>A captain of industry: the phrase is happy,
and convincing too is the passage wherein Mr.
Erskine Childers gives his impression of Andrews
as, towards the close of 1911, he saw him one
day working in the Island Yard.</p>

<p>“It was bracing to be near him,” writes Mr.
Childers, and then goes on: “His mind seemed
to revel in its mastery, both of the details and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>of the <i>ensemble</i>, both of the technical and the
human side of a great science, while restlessly
seeking to enlarge its outlook, conquer new
problems, and achieve an ever fresh perfection.
Whether it was about the pitch of a propeller
or the higher problems of design, speed, and
mercantile competition, one felt the same grip
and enthusiasm and, above all perhaps, the
same delight in frank self-revelation.”</p>


<h2>V.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">We</span> come back, then, to Andrews as Mr. Childers
saw him on that day in the Yard—big, strong,
inspiriting, full of enthusiasm and mastery—a
genuine captain of industry there on the scene
of his triumphs, yet revealing himself as
modestly, we know, as any of the great army
of workers under his direction.</p>

<p>Before attempting to give some further and
completer account of the relations which
existed between him and the Islanders, it may
be well to give a letter written by Andrews in
1905 to a young relative then beginning work
as an engineer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I am sorry I did not get a shake of your fist,
old chap, before leaving, just to wish you good
luck at your business and a good time at ——</p>

<p>“Please accept from me the enclosed small
gift to go towards a little pocket-money.</p>

<p>“You are such a sensible boy I know that
you require no advice from me, but as an old
hand who has come through the mill myself I
would just like to say how important it is for
you to endeavour to give your employers full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
confidence in you from the start. This can
best be gained:</p>

<p>“(1) By punctuality and close attention to
your work at all times—but don’t allow your
health to suffer through overwork.</p>

<p>“(2) Always carry out instructions given by
those above you, whether you agree with them
or not—and try to get instructions in writing
if you are not sure of your man.</p>

<p>“(3) Always treat those above you with
respect, no matter whether they are fools or
know less than yourself.</p>

<p>“(4) Never give information unless you are
perfectly sure, better to say you are not sure,
but will look the matter up.</p>

<p>“(5) Never be anxious to show how quick
you are by being the first out of the shop when
the horn blows. It is better on these occasions
to be a bit slow.</p>

<p>“Now this is a sermon by Thomas, but not
one of your father’s—only that of an old
cousin who has high expectations of you and is
interested in your welfare.</p>

<p>“Goodbye and good luck.”</p>
</div>

<p>That little sermon by Thomas, with its
admixture of shrewdness, wisdom, and kind-heartedness,
may be taken as embodying the
workaday rules of duty perfected by Andrews<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
through a varied experience of sixteen years—rules
doubtless as faithfully observed by himself
as they were commended for the guidance of
others. What may be called its horse sense,
its blunt avowal of how to play the game, helps
us towards a fuller understanding of the man,
puts him in the plain light through which,
every day in view of everyone, he passed. It
shows us why he succeeded, why in any circumstances
and irrespective almost of his higher
qualities, he was bound to succeed. It explains,
to some extent, what a workman meant in
calling him “a born leader of men.” It helps
us to understand why some called him a hard
man and why he made a few enemies; helps
us also to understand why the Islander who
threatened to drop a bag of rivets on his head
was treated with laughing amenity. What
Andrews demanded of others he exacted in
greater measure of himself. If at times he
enforced his code of conduct with sternness,
in that, as all who felt the weight of his
hand would eventually acknowledge, he was
but doing his plain duty. Did men skulk
or scamp their job, they must be shown
decisively that a shipyard was no place for
them. Someone discovered asleep on a nine
inch plank spanning an open ventilator must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
be taught discretion. But no bullying, no
unfairness—above all, no show of malice.</p>

<p>If in Andrews’ nature was no trace of maliciousness,
neither did there lurk in it any meanness.
Not once, but a thousand times, during
the past black months, has his character been
summed with characteristic terseness by the
Island shipwrights:</p>

<p>“Just as a judge.... Straight as a
die.... There wasn’t a crooked turn in
him”: simple phrases conveying a magnificent
tribute. For what better in anyone can you
have than the straightness of a die, whether you
regard him as man or master? And such
straightness in a shipbuilder is not that the
supreme quality?</p>

<p>At all events this quality of absolute rectitude,
so indispensable in other respects, was the main
quality which, in their personal relations with
him, won for Andrews the admiration and
esteem of the Islanders. They could trust him.
He would see fair play. “If he caught you
doing wrong he wasn’t afraid to tell you so.”
“If he found you breaking a rule he wouldn’t
fire you straight away, but would give you
the rough side of his tongue and a friendly
caution.” “So long as one reported a mistake
honestly he had consideration, but try to hide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it away and he blazed at you.” “He had a
grand eye for good work and a good man, and
the man who did good work, no matter who
he was, got a clap on the shoulder.” So the
Islanders, this man and that; and then once
more comes the crowning judgment on the
tongue of so many, “He was straight as a die.”</p>

<p>But not that one quality alone gained for
Andrews his great, one might say his unique,
popularity in the Yard. His vast knowledge,
his mastery of detail, his assiduity, his zest:
all these merits had their due effect upon the
men: and effective too was the desire he showed
always to get the best possible out of every
worker. It was not enough to <i>do</i> your job, he
expected you to <i>think</i> about it: and if from
your thinking resulted a suggestion it got his
best consideration. It might be worthless—never
mind, better luck next time; if it were
worth a cent, he would make it shine in your
eyes like a dollar.</p>

<p>In addition, were those more personal
qualities—emanations, so to speak, of the man’s
character: his generosity, kindliness, patience,
geniality, humour, humility, courage, that great
laugh of his, the winning smile, the fine breezy
presence: of those also the men had constant
and intimate experience. Anyone in trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
might be sure of his sympathy. After a
spell of sickness his handshake and hearty
greeting stirred new life in your blood. Once
he found a great fellow ill-treating a small
foreman who, for sufficient reason, had docked
his wages; whereupon Andrews took off his
coat and hammered the bully. During labour
and party troubles, he several times, at risk of
his life, saved men from the mob. One day,
in a gale, he climbed an eighty foot staging,
rescued the terrified man who had gone up to
secure the loose boards, and himself did the
work. Another day, he lent a hand to a shipwright
toiling across the yard under a heavy
beam, and as they went Andrews asked, “How
is it, M‘Ilwaine, you always like to be beside
me?” “Ah, sir,” was the reply, “it is
because you carry up well.”</p>

<p>These incidents, chosen from so many, enable
us to see why, in the words of the Island poet,
“though Andrews was our master we loved
him to a man.” He always carried up well,
“stood four-square to all the winds that blow.”
Too often, those in authority rule as tyrants,
using power like some Juggernaut crushing
under the beasts of burden. But Andrews,
following the example of his uncle, preferred to
rule beneficently as a man among his fellows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“One evening,” writes Mrs. Andrews, “my
husband and I were in the vicinity of Queen’s
Island, and noticing a long file of men going
home from work, he turned to me and said,
‘There go my pals, Nellie.’ I can never forget
the tone in his voice as he said that, it was as
though the men were as dear to him as his own
brothers. Afterwards, on a similar occasion, I
reminded him of the words, and he said, ‘Yes,
and they are real pals too.’”</p>

<p>You see now why a colleague, Mr. Saxon
Payne, secretary to Lord Pirrie, could write,
“It was not a case of liking him, we all loved
him”; and why during those awful days in
April, when hope of good news at last had gone,
the Yard was shrouded in gloom and rough men
cried like women. They had lost a pal. And
not they only. On both sides of the Atlantic,
wherever men resort whose business is in the
great waters, owners, commanders, directors,
managers, architects, engineers, ships officers,
stewards, sailors, the name Tom Andrews is
honoured to-day as that of one whose remarkable
combination of gifts claimed not only their
admiration, but their affection.</p>

<p>“What we are to do without Andrews,” said
a Belfast ship-owner, “I don’t know. He was
probably the best man in the world for his job—knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
everything—was ready for anything—could
manage everyone—and what a friend!
It’s irreparable. Surely of all men worth
saving he ought to have been saved. Yes,
saved by force, for only in that way could it
have been done.”</p>

<p>Here, too, it may be mentioned that during
his business career Andrews received many
acknowledgements of a gratifying description
from those whom in various ways he had
served—amongst others from the White Star
Company, the Hamburg American Company
and, what I daresay he valued as much, from
the stewards of the <i>Olympic</i>. Following the
announcement of his marriage, a Committee
was organised at the Yard for the purpose of
showing him in a tangible way the esteem of
the Islanders, but for business reasons, or perhaps
feeling a delicacy in accepting a compliment
without parallel in the history of the
Yard, he whilst making it plain how much
the kindly thought had moved him, felt constrained
to ask the Committee to desist.</p>

<p>One may end this imperfect chapter with
two more tributes, themselves without any
great literary merit perhaps, yet testifying
sincerely, one thinks, to the love which Andrews
inspired in everyone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Long ago, poor Doctor O’Loughlin wrote in
collaboration with the Purser of the <i>Oceanic</i>
some verses to be sung to the air <i>Tommy Atkins</i>.
Doubtless they have been sung at ship’s mess
on many a voyage, and perhaps have elsewhere
been printed. One verse is given here:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Neath a gantry high and mighty she had birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she’d bulk and length and height and mighty beam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world was only larger in its girth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she seemed to be a living moving dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she rode so grandly o’er the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she seemed a beauty decked in bright array.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the whistle sounded loudly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As she sailed along so proudly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we all cried out ‘She must be quite O.K.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh Tommy Tommy Andrews we are all so proud of you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to say we have the finest ship that e’er was built is true.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May your hand ne’er lose its cunning, we don’t care how winds may roar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For we know we have a frigate that can sail from shore to shore.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second tribute is taken from a <i>Lament</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
written by the Island poet in the ballad form
so popular in Ireland, and circulated widely
in the Yard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A Queen’s Island Trojan, he worked to the last;<br /></span>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">It</span> remains, before giving account of the finest
action of his life, to consider briefly, by way of
rounding his portrait, what we may call
Andrews’ outside aspect—the side, that is, he
might turn to some Committee of Experts
sitting in solemn judgment upon him as a
possible candidate for political honours.</p>

<p>That side, it may be said at once, is singularly
unpretentious; and indeed when we think of
his absorption, heart and soul, in what he
knew for him was best, who could expect, or
wish, it to be otherwise? In Ulster, heaven
knows, are publicists galore, and sufficient men
too willing to down tools at any outside horn-blow,
that we should the less admire one who
spoke only once in public, took no open part
in politics, and was not even a strong party-man.
He was, however, a member of the Ulster
Reform Club. Twice he was pressed to accept
the presidency of Unionist Clubs. Frequently
he was urged to permit his nomination for
election to the City Council. The Belfast
Harbour Board shared the opinion of one
of its leading members that “his youthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
vigour, his undoubted ability, and his genial
personality, would have made him an acquisition
to this important Board.” His fellow-directors,
in a resolution of condolence, expressed
their feeling that “not only had the
Firm lost a valued and promising leader, but
the city an upright and capable citizen, who,
had he lived, would have taken a still more
conspicuous place in the industrial and commercial
world.” Even in the south, where
admiration of Northerners is not commonly
fervent, it was admitted by many that in
Andrews Ulster had at last found the makings
of a leader.</p>

<p>From such straws, blown in so prevailing a
wind, we may determine the estimation in
which Andrews, as a prospective citizen, stood
amongst those who knew him and their own
needs the best; and also perhaps may roughly
calculate the possibilities of that future which
he himself, in stray minutes of leisure, may have
anticipated. But some there will be doubtless
whose admiration of Andrews is the finer
because he kept the path of his career straight
to its course without any deviation to enticing
havens.</p>

<p>Such a man, however, the son of such a father,
could not fail to have views on the burning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
topics of his time, and no estimate of him
would be complete which gave these no heed.</p>

<p>He was, we are told, an Imperialist, loving
peace and consequently in favour of an unchallengeable
Navy. He was a firm Unionist,
being convinced that Home Rule would spell
financial ruin to Ireland, through the partial
loss of British credit, and of the security derived
from connection with a strong and prosperous
partner. At times he was known to express
disapproval of the policy adopted by those Irish
Unionists who strove to influence British electors
by appeals to passion rather than by means
of reasoned argument. Also he felt that
Ireland would never be happy and prosperous
until agitation ceased and promise of security
were offered to the investing capitalist.</p>

<p>Though no believer in modern cities, he was
of opinion that an effort should be made to
expand and stimulate Irish village life, it
seeming to him that a country dependent
solely on agriculture was like a man fighting the
battle of life with one hand. Were, however,
an approved system of agriculture, such as that
advocated by Sir Horace Plunkett, joined with
a considered scheme of town and village
industries, he believed that emigration would
cease and Ireland find prosperity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>To the practical application of Tariff Reform
he saw many difficulties, but thought
them not insuperable. In view of the needs of
a world-wide and growing Empire, “the necessity
of preserving British work for British
people,” and the injury done to home trade by
the unfair competition of protected countries,
he judged that the duties upon imported
necessities should be materially reduced and a
counterbalancing tax levied on all articles of
foreign manufacture.</p>

<p>He advocated moderate Social reform on
lines carefully designed to encourage thrift,
temperance and endeavour; and as one prime
means towards improving the condition, both
moral and physical, of the workers he would
have the State, either directly or through local
authorities, provide them with decent homes.</p>

<p>To the consideration of Labour problems,
particularly those coming within the scope of
his own experience, he gave much thought;
and when it is considered that his great popularity
with all classes held steady through the
recent period of industrial unrest, we may
judge that his attitude towards Labour, in the
mass as in the unit, was no mere personal
expression of friendliness. As his real pals he
wanted to help the workers, educate and lift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
them. Other things being equal, he always
favoured the men who used their heads as well
as their hands; and if in the management of
their own affairs they used their heads, then
also, so much the better for all concerned.
He considered that both in the interests of
men and masters, it was well for Labour to be
organized under capable leaders; but honest
agreements should, he thought, be binding on
both sides and not liable to governmental
interference. Politicians and others should in
their public utterances, he felt, endeavour to
educate the workers in the principles of economics
relative to trade, wages and the relations
between capital and labour; but publicists
who, for party or like reasons, strove to foster
class hatreds and strifes he would hang by the
heels from a gantry.</p>

<p>Where economically possible, the working
day should, he thought, be shortened, especially
the day of all toiling in arduous and unwholesome
conditions. Similarly he was disposed to
favour, when economically possible, encouragement
of the workers by means of a system of
profit sharing. He would, furthermore, give
them every facility for technical education, but
such he knew from experience was of little value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
unless supplemented by thorough practical
knowledge gained in the workshop.</p>

<p>These views and opinions, whatever their
intrinsic value in the eyes of experts, are at least
interesting. Sooner or later, had Andrews
lived, he would perhaps have made them the
basis of public pronouncements; and then
indeed might his abounding energy, applied in
new and luring directions, have carried him to
heights of citizenship.</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">Happily</span>, there is no need in these pages to
attempt any minute estimate of the share
Andrews had in building the <i>Titanic</i>. Such a
task, were it feasible, would offer difficulties no
less testing than those met courageously by
half the world’s journalists when attempting to
describe the wonders of that ill-fated vessel—her
length that of a suburban street, her height
the equivalent of a seventeen story building,
her elevator cars coursing up and down as
through a city hotel, her millionaire suites, her
luxuries of squash racquet courts, Turkish and
electric bath establishments, salt water swimming
pools, glass enclosed sun parlours,
verandah caf&eacute;s, and all. Probably no one man,
was solely responsible for the beautiful thing.
She was an evolution rather than a creation,
triumphant product of numberless experiments,
a perfection embodying who knows what
endeavour, from this a little, from that a little
more, of human brain and hand and imagination.
How many ships were built, how many
lost; how many men lived, wrought, and died
that the <i>Titanic</i> might be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>So much being said, it may however be said
further, that to her building Andrews gave as
much of himself as did any other man. All his
experience of ships, gained in the yards, on
voyages, by long study, was in her; all his deep
knowledge, too, gathered during twenty years
and now applied in a crowning effort with an
ardour that never flagged. It was by the
<i>Titanic</i>, “her vast shape slowly assuming the
beauty and symmetry which are but a memory
to-day,” that Mr. Childers met Andrews and
noted in him those qualities of zest, vigour,
power and simplicity, which impressed him
deeply. Yet Andrews then was no whit more
enthusiastic, we feel sure, than on any other
day of the great ship’s fashioning, from the
time of her conception slowly down through
the long process of calculating, planning,
designing, building, fitting, until at last she
sailed proudly away to the applause of half the
world. Whatever share others had in her, his
at least cannot be gainsaid. As Lord Pirrie’s
Assistant he had done his part by way of shaping
into tangible form the projects of her owners.
As Chief Designer and Naval Architect he
planned her complete. As Managing Director
he saw her grow up, frame by frame, plate by
plate, day after day throughout more than two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
years; watched her grow as a father watches
his child grow, assiduously, minutely, and with
much the same feelings of parental pride and
affection. For Andrews this was <i>his</i> ship,
whatever his hand in her: and in that she was
“efficiently designed and constructed” as is
now established<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> his fame as a Shipbuilder may
well rest. As surely none other did, he knew
her inside and out, her every turn and art, the
power and beauty of her, from keel to truck—knew
her to the last rivet. And because he
knew the great ship so well, as a father knows
the child born to him, therefore to lose her
was heartbreak.</p>

<p class="caption">THE “TITANIC” LEAVING BELFAST</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, April 2nd, 1912, at
6 a.m., the <i>Titanic</i> left Belfast, in ideal weather,
and was towed down Channel to complete her
trials. On board was Andrews, representing
the Firm. Her compasses being adjusted, the
ship steamed towards the Isle of Man, and after
a satisfactory run returned to the Lough about
6 p.m. Throughout the whole day Andrews
was busy, receiving representatives of the
owners, inspecting and superintending the work
of internal completion, and taking notes.
“Just a line,” he wrote to Mrs. Andrews, “to
let you know that we got away this morning in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>fine style and have had a very satisfactory trial.
We are getting more ship-shape every hour, but
there is still a great deal to be done.”</p>

<p>Having received letters and transferred workmen,
the ship left immediately for Southampton,
Andrews still on board and with him, amongst
others, the eight brave men from the Island
Yard who perished with him. They were:</p>

<ul><li>William Henry Marsh Parr, Assistant Manager Electrical Department.</li>

<li>Roderick Chisholm, Ships’ Draughtsman.</li>

<li>Anthony W. Frost, Outside Foreman Engineer.</li>

<li>Robert Knight, Leading Hand Engineer.</li>

<li>William Campbell, Joiner Apprentice.</li>

<li>Alfred  Fleming Cunningham, Fitter Apprentice.</li>

<li>Frank Parkes, Plumber Apprentice.</li>

<li>Ennis Hastings Watson, Electrician Apprentice.</li></ul>


<p>During the whole of Wednesday, the 3rd,
until midnight, when the ship arrived at
Southampton, Andrews was ceaselessly employed
going round with representatives of the
owners and of the Firm, in taking notes and
preparing reports of work still to be done. All
the next day, from an early hour, he spent with
managers and foremen putting work in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening he wrote to Mrs. Andrews:
“I wired you this morning of our safe arrival
after a very satisfactory trip. The weather
was good and everyone most pleasant. I think
the ship will clean up all right before sailing on
Wednesday”: and then he mentions that the
doctors refused to allow Lord Pirrie to make
the maiden voyage.</p>

<p>Thereafter from day to day, until the date
of sailing, he was always busy, taking the owners
round ship, interviewing engineers, officials,
agents, managers, sub-contractors, discussing
with principals the plans of new ships, and
superintending generally the work of completion.</p>

<p>“Through the various days that the vessel
lay at Southampton,” writes his Secretary, Mr.
Thompson Hamilton, “Mr. Andrews was never
for a moment idle. He generally left his hotel
about 8.30 for the offices, where he dealt with
his correspondence, then went on board until
6.30, when he would return to the offices to
sign letters. During the day I took to the ship
any urgent papers and he always dealt with
them no matter what his business.” Nothing
he allowed to interfere with duty. He was
conscientious to the minutest detail. “He
would himself put in their place such things as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
racks, tables, chairs, berth ladders, electric fans,
saving that except he saw everything right he
could not be satisfied.”</p>

<p>One of the last letters he wrote records serious
trouble with the restaurant galley hot press,
and directs attention to a design for reducing
the number of screws in stateroom hat hooks.</p>

<p>Another of earlier date, in the midst of
technicalities about cofferdams and submerged
cylinders on the propeller boss, expresses agreement
with the owner that the colouring of the
pebble dashing on the private promenade
decks was too dark, and notes a plan for staining
green the wicker furniture on one side of the
vessel.</p>

<p>Withal, his thought for others never failed.
Now he is arranging for a party to view the
ship; now writing to a colleague, “I have
always in mind a week’s holiday due to you
from last summer and shall be glad if you will
make arrangements to take these on my return,
as, although you may not desire to have them, I
feel sure that a week’s rest will do you good.”</p>

<p>On the evening of Sunday, the 7th, he wrote
to Mrs. Andrews giving her news of his movements
and dwelling upon the plans he had in
mind for the future.</p>

<p>On the 9th he wrote: “The <i>Titanic</i> is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
about complete and will I think do the old
Firm credit to-morrow when we sail.”</p>

<p>On the 10th he was aboard at 6 o’clock, and
thence until the hour of sailing he spent in a
long final inspection of the ship. She pleased
him. The old Firm was sure of its credit.
Just before the moorings were cast off he bade
goodbye to Mr. Hamilton and the other
officials. He seemed in excellent health and
spirits. His last words were, “Remember now
and keep Mrs. Andrews informed of any news
of the vessel.”</p>

<p>The <i>Titanic</i>, carrying 2,201 souls, left
Southampton punctually at noon on April
10th. There was no departure ceremony. On
her way from dock she passed the <i>Majestic</i> and
the <i>Philadelphia</i>, both giants of twenty years
ago and now by contrast with Leviathan
humbled to the stature of dwarfs. About a
mile down the water she passed Test Quay,
where the <i>Oceanic</i> and the <i>New York</i> lay
berthed. Her wash caused the <i>New York</i> to
break her moorings and drift into the Channel.
As the <i>Titanic</i> was going dead slow danger of a
collision was soon averted, “but,” as Andrews
wrote that evening, “the situation was
decidedly unpleasant.”</p>

<p>From Cherbourg he wrote again to Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Andrews: “We reached here in nice time and
took on board quite a number of passengers.
The two little tenders looked well, you will
remember we built them about a year ago.
We expect to arrive at Queenstown about
10.30 a.m. to-morrow. The weather is fine
and everything shaping for a good voyage. I
have a seat at the Doctor’s table.”</p>

<p>One more letter was received from him by
Mrs. Andrews, and only one, this time from
Queenstown, and dated April 11th. Everything
on board was going splendidly, he said,
and he expressed his satisfaction at receiving
so much kindness from everyone.</p>

<p>Here all direct testimony ceases. Proudly,
in eye of the world, the <i>Titanic</i> sailed Westward
from the Irish coast; then for a while disappeared;
only to reappear in a brief scene of
woefullest tragedy round which the world
stayed mute. If, as is almost certain, a
chronicle of the voyage was made by Andrews,
both it and the family letters he wrote now are
gone with him. But fortunately, we have other
evidence, plentiful and well-attested, and on
such our story henceforward runs.</p>

<p>The steward, Henry E. Etches, who attended
him says, that during the voyage, right to the
moment of disaster, Andrews was constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
busy. With his workmen he went about the
boat all day long, putting things right and
making note of every suggestion of an imperfection.
Afterwards in his stateroom, which is
described as being full of charts, he would sit
for hours, making calculations and drawings
for future use.</p>

<p>Others speak of his great popularity with both
passengers and crew. “I was proud of him,”
writes the brave stewardess, Miss May Sloan,
of Belfast, whose testimony is so invaluable.
“He came from home and he made you feel on
the ship that all was right.” And then she adds
how because of his big, gentle, kindly nature
everyone loved him. “It was good to hear his
laugh and have him near you. If anything
went wrong it was always to Mr. Andrews one
went. Even when a fan stuck in a stateroom,
one would say, ‘Wait for Mr. Andrews, he’ll
soon see to it,’ and you would find him settling
even the little quarrels that arose between
ourselves. Nothing came amiss to him, nothing
at all. And he was always the same, a nod and
a smile or a hearty word whenever he saw you
and no matter what he was at.”</p>

<p>Two of his table companions, Mr. and Mrs.
Albert A. Dick, of Calgary, Alberta, also tell
how much they came to love Andrews because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of his character, and how good it was to see his
pride in the ship, “but upon every occasion, and
especially at dinner on Sunday evening, he
talked almost constantly about his wife, little
girl, mother and family, as well as of his home.”</p>

<p>This pre-occupation with home and all there,
was noticed too by Miss Sloan. Sometimes,
between laughs, he would suddenly fall grave
and glance, you might say, back over a shoulder
towards Dunallan and Ardara far off near
Strangford Lough.</p>

<p>“I was talking to him on the Friday night as
he was going into dinner,” writes Miss Sloan,
in a letter dated from the <i>Lapland</i> on April
27th. “The dear old Doctor<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was waiting for
him on the stair-landing, and calling him by
his Christian name, Tommy. Mr. Andrews
seemed loth to go, he wanted to talk about
home; he was telling me his father was ill and
Mrs. Andrews not so well. I was congratulating
him on the beauty and perfection of the ship;
he said the part he did not like was that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><i>Titanic</i> was taking us further away from home
every hour. I looked at him and his face struck
me as having a very sad expression.”</p>

<p>One other glimpse we have of him, then in
that brief time of triumph, whilst yet the good
ship of his which everyone praised was speeding
Westwards, “in perfectly clear and fine
weather,” towards the place where “was no
moon, the stars were out, and there was not a
cloud in the sky.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> For more than a week he
had been working at such pressure, that by the
Friday evening many saw how tired as well as
sad he looked: but by the Sunday evening,
when his ship was as perfect, so he said, as
brains could make her, he was himself again.
“I saw him go in to dinner,” said Miss Sloan,
“he was in good spirits, and I thought he
looked splendid.”</p>

<p>An hour or two afterwards he went aft to
thank the baker for some special bread he had
made for him; then back to his stateroom,
where apparently he changed into working
clothes, and sat down to write.</p>

<p>He was still writing, it would seem, when
the Captain called him.</p>


<h2>VIII.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></h2>


<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">On</span> the night of Sunday, 14th April, at 11 40
ship’s time, in clear fine weather, near Latitude
41&deg; 46′ N., Longitude 50&deg; 14′ W., the <i>Titanic</i>
collided with the submerged spur of an iceberg
and ripped her starboard side ten feet above
the level of the keel for a length of about
three hundred feet, thereby giving access to
the sea in six of her forward compartments.</p>

<p>The calamity came with dreadful swiftness.
In the vivid words of a stoker, on duty at the
time of collision some two hundred and fifty
feet from the stem: “All of a sudden the
starboard side of the ship came in upon us; it
burst like a big gun going off; the water came
pouring in and swilled our legs.” Within ten
minutes the water rose fourteen feet above the
keel in five of the compartments; afterwards it
rose steadily in all six; and by midnight had
submerged the lower deck in the foremost hold.
Yet so gentle apparently was the shock of contact
that among the passengers, and probably
among most of the crew as well, it was only the
stopping of the engines that warned them of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
some happening; whilst for a considerable time,
so quietly the great ship lay on the flat sea,
such confidence had all in her strength, and so
orderly was everything, that to many, almost
to the last, it seemed impossible that disaster
had come.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>“At first we did not realise,” says Mr. Albert
Dick,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “that the <i>Titanic</i> was mortally wounded....
I do not believe that anyone on her
realised she was going to sink.” Mr. Dick goes
on to record that, in his view, nothing deserved
more praise than the conduct of Andrews after
the ship had struck. “He was on hand at once
and said that he was going below to investigate.
We begged him not to go, but he insisted, saying
he knew the ship as no one else did and that he
might be able to allay the fears of the passengers.
He went.</p>

<p>“As the minutes flew by we did not know
what to do or which way to turn.... Captain
Smith was everywhere doing his best to calm
the rising tide of fear.... But in the minds of
most of us there was ... the feeling that
something was going to happen, and we waited
for Mr. Andrews to come back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p><p>“When he came we hung upon his words, and
they were these: ‘There is no cause for any
excitement. All of you get what you can in
the way of clothes and come on deck as soon
as you can. She is torn to bits below, but she
will not sink if her after bulkheads hold.’</p>

<p>“It seemed almost impossible that this could
be true ... and many in the crowd smiled,
thinking this was merely a little extra knowledge
that Mr. Andrews saw fit to impart....”</p>

<p>It is almost certain that Andrews, who knew
the ship as no one else did, realised at his first
sight of her wounds—a three hundred feet gash,
six compartments open to the sea and perhaps
twenty feet of water in one or more of them—that
she was doomed. Possibly with some of his
faithful assistants, probably with Captain Smith,
he had made a thorough examination of the
damaged side, reporting to the Captain as
result of his examination that the ship could
not live more than an hour and a half, and
advising him to clear away the boats.</p>

<p>How this order was carried out, with what
skill and unselfishness on the part of Captain
Smith and his officers, has been told elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
in full detail; nor is it necessary to record
further here than that eventually, after two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>hours of heroic work, a total of 652 lives left the
<i>Titanic</i> in eighteen boats. Subsequently 60
more were rescued from the sea, or transferred
from the collapsibles, making a sum total of
712 rescued by the <i>Carpathia</i>. 712 out of
2,201: it seems tragically few! Yet at midnight
it may have seemed to Andrews that
fewer still could be saved, for not even he
hoped that his ship could live for two hours
and twenty minutes more.</p>

<p>As he came up from the grim work of investigation
he saw Miss Sloan and told her that as
an accident had happened it would be well,
just by way of precaution, to get her passengers
to put on warm clothing and their life belts
and assemble on the Boat deck. But she read
his face, “which had a look as though he were
heart broken,” and asked him if the accident
were not serious. He said it was very serious;
then, bidding her keep the bad news quiet for
fear of panic, he hurried away to the work of
warning and rescue.</p>

<p>Another stewardess gives an account of
Andrews, bareheaded and insufficiently clad
against the icy cold, going quietly about bidding
the attendants to rouse all passengers and get
them up to the boats.</p>

<p>Overhearing him say to Captain Smith on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Upper deck, “Well, three have gone already,
Captain,” she ran to the lower stairway and to
her surprise found water within six steps of her
feet. Whereupon she hurried above to summon
help, and returning met Andrews, who told her
to advise passengers to leave the Upper deck.</p>

<p>Ten minutes went. The water had crept
further up the stairway. Again Andrews came
to her and said, “Tell them to put on warm
clothing, see that everyone has a lifebelt and
get them all up to the Boat deck.”</p>

<p>Another fifteen minutes went. The top of
the stairway was now nearly awash. A second
time Andrews came. “Open up all the spare
rooms,” he ordered. “Take out all lifebelts
and spare blankets and distribute them.”</p>

<p>This was done. Attendants and passengers
went above to the Boat deck. But returning
for more belts, the stewardess again met
Andrews. He asked her whether all the ladies
had left their rooms. She answered “Yes, but
would make sure.”</p>

<p>“Go round again,” said he; and then, “Did
I not tell you to put on your lifebelt. Surely
you have one?”</p>

<p>She answered “Yes, but I thought it means
to wear it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said he. “Now, if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
value your life, put on your coat and belt, then
walk round the deck and let the passengers see
you.”</p>

<p>“He left me then,” writes the stewardess,
“and that was the last I saw of what I consider
a true hero and one of whom his country has
cause to be proud.”</p>

<p>In how far Andrews’ efforts and example
were the means of averting what might well
have been an awful panic, cannot be said; but
sure it is that all one man could do in such
service, both personally and by way of assisting
the ship’s officers, was done by him. “He
was here, there and everywhere,” says Miss
Sloan, “looking after everybody, telling the
women to put on lifebelts, telling the
stewardesses to hurry the women up to the
boats, all about everywhere, thinking of everyone
but himself.”</p>

<p>Others tell a similar story, how calm and
unselfish he was, now pausing on his way to the
engine-room to reassure some passengers, now
earnestly begging women to be quick, now
helping one to put on her lifebelt—“all about
everywhere, thinking of everybody but himself.”</p>

<p>It is certain also that on the Boat deck he
gave invaluable help to the officers and men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
engaged in the work of rescue. Being familiar
with the boats’ tackle and arrangement he was
able to aid effectively at their launching; and
it was whilst going quietly from boat to boat,
probably in those tragic intervals during which
the stewardess watched the water creep up the
stairway, that he was heard to say: “Now,
men, remember you are Englishmen. Women
and children first.”</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes before the end, when
the last distress signal had been fired in vain,
when all that Upper deck and the Fore deck
as well were ravaged by the sea, there was a
crush and a little confusion near the place where
the few remaining boats were being lowered,
women and children shrinking back, some afraid
to venture, some preferring to stay with their
husbands, a few perhaps in the grip of cold and
terror. Then Andrews came and waving his
arms gave loud command:</p>

<p>“Ladies, you must get in at once. There is
not a minute to lose. You cannot pick and
choose your boat. Don’t hesitate. Get in,
get in!”</p>

<p>They obeyed him. Do they remember
to-day, any of them, that to him they, as so
many more, may owe their lives?</p>

<p>A little way back from that scene, Miss Sloan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
stood calmly waiting and seeing Andrews
for the last time. She herself was not very
anxious to leave the ship, for all her friends were
staying behind and she felt it was mean to go.
But the command of the man, who for nearly
two hours she had seen doing as splendidly as
now he was doing, came imperatively. “Don’t
hesitate! There’s not a moment to lose. Get
in!” So she stepped into the last boat and
was saved.</p>

<p>It was then five minutes past two. The
<i>Titanic</i> had fifteen minutes more to live.</p>

<p>Well, all was done now that could be done,
and the time remaining was short. The Forecastle
head was under water. All around, out
on the sea, so calm under those wonderful stars,
the boats were scattered, some near, some a
mile away or more, the eyes of most in them
turned back upon the doomed ship as one by one
her port lights, that still burnt row above row
in dreadful sloping lines, sank slowly into darkness.
Soon the lines would tilt upright, then
flash out and flash bright again; then, as the
engines crashed down through the bulkheads,
go out once more, and leave that awful form
standing up against the sky, motionless, black,
preparing for the final plunge.</p>

<p>But that time was not yet. Some fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
minutes were left: and in those minutes we
still have sight of Andrews.</p>

<p>One met him, bareheaded and carrying a
lifebelt, on his way to the bridge perhaps to bid
the Captain goodbye.</p>

<p>Later, an assistant steward saw him standing
alone in the smoking-room, his arms folded over
his breast and the belt lying on a table near
him. The steward asked him, “Aren’t you
going to have a try for it, Mr. Andrews?”</p>

<p>He never answered or moved, “just stood
like one stunned.”</p>

<p>What did he see as he stood there, alone,
rapt? We who know the man and his record
can believe that before him was home and all
the loved ones there, wife and child, father and
mother, brothers and sister, relatives, friends—that
picture and all it meant to him then and
there; and besides, just for a moment maybe,
and as background to all that, swift realisation
of the awful tragedy ending his life, ending his
ship.</p>

<p>But whatever he saw, in that quiet lonely
minute, it did not hold or unman him. Work—work—he
must work to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Some saw him for the last time, down in the
Engine-room, with Chief engineer Bell and
Archie Frost and the other heroes, all toiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
like men to keep the lights going and the pumps
at work.</p>

<p>Others saw him, a few minutes before the
end, on the Boat deck, our final and grandest
sight of him, throwing deck chairs overboard to
the unfortunates struggling in the water below.</p>

<p>Then, with a slow long slanting dive, the
<i>Titanic</i> went down, giving to the sea her short-spanned
life and with it the life of Thomas
Andrews.</p>

<p>So died this noble man. We may hope that
he lies, as indeed he might be proud to lie,
in the great ship he had helped to fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>After accident Andrews ascertained damage, advised
passengers to put on heavy clothing and prepare to
leave vessel. Many were sceptical about the seriousness
of the damage, but impressed by Andrews’ knowledge
and personality, followed his advice, and so saved
their lives. He assisted many women and children to
lifeboats. When last seen, officers say, he was throwing
overboard deck chairs and other objects to people
in the water, his chief concern the safety of everyone

<p>Forgive me for intruding upon your grief, but
I feel I must send you a line to convey my most deep
and sincere sympathy with you in the terrible loss you
have suffered. It is impossible for me to express in
words all I feel, or make you realise how truly sorry I
am for you, or how my heart goes out to you. I knew
your husband for many years, and had the highest
regard for him, and looked upon him as a true friend.
No one who had the pleasure of knowing him could
fail to realise and appreciate his numerous good qualities
and he will be sadly missed in his profession. Nobody
did more for the White Star Line, or was more loyal to
its interests than your good husband, and I always
placed the utmost reliance on his judgment.</p>

<p>If we miss him and feel his loss so keenly, what your
feelings must be I cannot think. Words at such a time
are useless, but I could not help writing to you to tell
you how truly deeply I feel for you in your grief and
sorrow.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 2em" class="center"><i>Letter from Sir Horace Plunkett to Right Hon. Thomas
Andrews.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 3em">The Plunkett House,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Dublin</span>, <i>19th April</i>, 1912.</p>

<p class="ni"><span class="smcap">My Dear Andrews</span>,</p>

<p>No act of friendship is so difficult as the letter
of condolence upon the loss of one who is near and
dear. Strive as we may to avoid vapid conventionality,
we find ourselves drifting into reflections upon
the course of nature, the cessation of suffering, the
worse that might have been, and such offers of comfort
to others which we are conscious would be of little
help to ourselves. In writing to you and your wife
on the sorrow of two worlds, which has fallen so
heavily upon your home and family, I feel no such
difficulty. There is no temptation to be conventional,
but it is hard to express in words the very real
consolation which will long be cherished by the wide
circle of those now bitterly deploring the early death
of one who was clearly marked out for a great career
in the chief <i>doing</i> part of Irish life.</p>

<p>Of the worth of your son I need not speak to you—nothing
I could say of his character or capacity could
add to your pride in him. But you ought to know
that we all feel how entirely to his own merits was due
the extraordinary rapidity of his rise and the acknowledged
certainty of his leadership in what Ulster stands
for before the world. When I first saw him in the
shipyard he was in a humble position, enjoying no
advantage on account of your relationship to one of
his employers. Even then, as on many subsequent
occasions, I learned, or heard from my Irish fellow-workers,
that this splendid son of yours had the best
kind of public spirit—that which made you and Sinclair
save the Recess Committee at its crisis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be that the story of your poor boy’s death
will never be told, but I seem to see it all. I have
just come off the sister ship, whose captain was a personal
friend, as was the old doctor who went with him
to the <i>Titanic</i>. I have been often in the fog among
the icebergs. I have heard, in over sixty voyages,
many of those awful tales of the sea. I know enough
to be aware that your son might easily have saved himself
on grounds of public duty none could gainsay.
What better witness could be found to tell the millions
who would want and had a right to know why the great
ship failed, and how her successors could be made, as
she was believed to be, unsinkable? None of his breed
could listen to such promptings of the lower self when
the call came to show to what height the real man in
him could rise. I think of him displaying the very
highest quality of courage—the true heroism—without
any of the stimulants which the glamour and prizes
of battle supply—doing all he could for the women and
children—and then going grimly and silently to his
glorious grave.</p>

<p>So there is a bright side to the picture which you of
his blood and his widow must try to share with his and
your friends—with the thousands who will treasure
his memory. It will help you in your bereavement,
and that is why I intrude upon your sorrow with a
longer letter than would suffice to tender to you and
Mrs. Andrews and to all your family circle a tribute of
heartfelt sympathy.</p>

<p>Pray accept this as coming not only from myself
but also from those intimately associated with me in the
Irish work which brought me, among other blessings,
the friendship of men like yourself.</p>

Belfast men who died in the wreck has been generously subscribed

He is also included amongst those to whom a similar

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It is interesting to note the circumstances which brought
these two men together. Mr. Adams, who is now Professor
of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford, was then
Superintendent of Statistics and Intelligence in the Irish
Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. He
went to Andrews as the man most likely to give him reliable
information and sound opinions upon certain industrial
questions of interest to the Department. A peculiar value
attaches to the high regard in which Thomas Andrews was
held by this distinguished political and economic thinker.</p></div>
